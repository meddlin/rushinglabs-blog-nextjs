## To Share My Progress

As I move further along in my career, I'm finding more instances where I wished I could've looked to others for simple answers on things.

Whether it be:

- Advice on skills to focus on
- How to start working on something
- ...or what "progress" looks like

I tend to find sitting down to *focus on something* to learn isn't quite as difficult as knowing where my focus *should be*. I find this is most pronounced in traversing a career--how to make that bridge from one milestone to the next. It's this type of progress, along with the learning process in the technical details, that I hope to share.

## Messy Middle

From the time I first took apart a computer to when I started my career as a developer, it was clear I was a beginner. However, as I started getting exposed to more technologies, more design patterns, more possibilities, it was then that I started learning how vast software engineering could be—_let alone computer science!_

It was easy to find "beginner" material (i.e. "how to start `[insert topic]`"), but it always seemed limited. Then on the other end of the spectrum there were plenty of talks and resources at an "expert" level I couldn't understand. I could see value existed, but I didn't know how to connect the pieces.

I hope to help others navigate that space where they feel they know enough to start but not enough to do anything substantial. I'm still growing through this myself, but I don't think that should stop anyone from reaching back to help those they can.

And if you have this similar sense, but don't feel you've found a solution... _**Hint**—you're closer than you think_.

## An Alternative Solution (to a growing problem)

It seems more so recently then before, there has been a growing concern of repairability, data privacy, and control. These issues have bothered me for a while now. There is plenty to dive into in each of these topics, and needless to say the complex issues underneath are enough to drive anyone to the end of their patience. In the end, the best solution I know to present is to simply provide, the tools I have, to as many people as possible.

Honestly, I wish I knew more about these topics. Going along with my previous points though, I hope to share my progress and point others in the direction they want to go. At the end of the day, what I'm most concerned with is making sure we can all continue to use the technology we have with freedom and ethics.

## Anything Else?

So, these are the three main driving points for why I'm starting a channel: to share my progress, to navigate the messy middle, and provide alternative solutions. I'm sure these reasons will change and grow over time. Either way, I felt it was good to share where it's all starting from to see how it grows.

There's a lot to dive into and I hope it's enjoyable to watch along the way.

_As always, keep building._
